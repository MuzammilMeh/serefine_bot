Sorry, can you say again? Yes, I'm just double checking for you to see  if we would input the total in us dollars or canadian dollars okay so we'll see if they could  if the expense team will convert it on their end or if we convert it here so we so i put them out  81 dollars from us right yeah so that's what it's looking like. That's the feedback I'm getting is that  we're going to put it in US dollars  and it will be converted  with the expense team.  So if I want to change,  how to change?  So you can scroll up.  Scroll up, yeah.  Okay.  Scroll down and let's see, can you can you click on it?  Can you click on the expense?  Can you move this bar over?  See if there's an added button. There you go. So there's the added button.  So, do we need to put the U.S. money? No.  I don't think so.  So and then how do you know how they know U.S. money?  Because it's on the receipt, right? Now they know US money.  Because it's on the receipt, right?  It's on the receipt.  It says it's in US dollars.  Okay.  So then they'll convert it and...  But I already did write the amount 1170 is already in there.  Right, you've already put it there.  So I just have a little bit more feedback coming in here.  Just want to make sure we're doing it right for you so that when you submit it, it'll  go through okay. Can you wait to take another way back?  Sure.  Thank you.  No problem. Okay. Takk for ating med. Okay.  Okay.  So we can submit now or need to wait. Let's see.  Okay.  So what I'm being told right now is that you're going to need  to show the amount in Canadian dollars.  So you're gonna need to add the credit  card bill and the invoice so okay so what it looks like is did you pay via  credit card right yes okay so it looks you're gonna take a picture of the credit card of the  credit card statement and the invoice together and then we'll submit that you  will if you are welcome to black out any other information to the FBA with PayPal and we take a picture on the paper in there okay yeah so you  could do that so you need to but because you can only submit the the one picture  you have to take a picture the two together like side by side or one above the other? Oh, because you know this one is already double now.  Yeah.  So this is the one from the US, right?  Yeah.  If I want to add more pictures, I don't know how to add them all because it's not clear.  You will run out of room. Yeah, so I wonder if you could do it together.  You know, do you have like a PDF reader on your phone?  Because you can take all three pages together and send it in one picture.  With...  PDF.  Uh...  I don't think that we have PDF.  Maybe go to google  um They say go to the.
